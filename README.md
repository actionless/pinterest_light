# pinterest_light firefox/chrome extension
A lightweight pinterest button WebExtension.



## Description

Extremely lightweight unofficial addon for pinning things to Pinterest.

It's not injecting any javascript to the pages you browse normally (as official addon does to insert "Pin it" button to images and so on).
When you press the addon button it just opens Pinterest in a new tab with the current page selected for picking images to pin.
